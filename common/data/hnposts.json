Google Groups sucks for moderation, and I <i>THINK</i> you could probably make something awesome.  Think about how Trac and the Wiki were integrated, for instance, and how you could automatically hyperlink between threads and tickets.  The reason I say this is often GitHub creates a &quot;throw code at project&quot; methodology, which is bound to upset both contributor and maintainer - when often a &quot;how should I do this&quot; discussion first saves work.  Yet joining a Google Group is a lot of commitment for people, and they probably don&#x27;t want the email.  Something to think about, perhaps.<p>Also think about StackOverflow.  It&#x27;s kind of a wasteland of questions, but if there was a users-helping-users type area, it would reduce tickets that were not really bugs, but really requests for help.

It&#x27;s a word that&#x27;s used in many different ways in different contexts.<p>Fact is, actual direct subsidies for fossil are quite low, they range in the billions. i.e. say the costs of oil businesses to produce and sell oil profitably is $100 per barrel, but they receive $10 from the government per barrel and sell at $90, that&#x27;s a pre-tax or &#x27;direct&#x27; subsidy. That&#x27;s usually what we talk about when we talk about subsidies, a company receiving extra money, financial support.<p>This ranges in the hundreds of billions worldwide, which is a fraction of a percent of the world economy. Significant, yes, but not in the grander context.<p>Then there&#x27;s post-tax subsidies, these range in the trillions. They&#x27;re not actually money received by oil companies, and therefore it&#x27;s misleading to the &#x27;everyday man&#x27; to talk about subsidies because that&#x27;s what the everyday man thinks about when he hears the word &#x27;subsidy&#x27;.<p>What are these subsidies? Well say there&#x27;s smog from cars that run on oil, and smog causes cancer and cancer causes healthcare costs and lost labor force due to death. Put a price on that, and you have a cost of oil that society has to pay for, that isn&#x27;t priced into oil. You can price it in through tariffs and taxes and such, not doing so means oil companies generate costs onto society that they&#x27;re not having to pay for. And if you add it all up, it&#x27;s trillions of dollars, and that&#x27;s when you get to the oft-cited &#x27;subsidy figure&#x27; of $5 trillion from an IMF study. This isn&#x27;t money these companies are receiving, it&#x27;s money they&#x27;re not being forced to pay up.<p>Now you can think what you want. I&#x27;m of the opinion these externalities should be priced in, and paid for by oil companies (and indirectly by the customers, who will change behaviour as fossil becomes more expensive, which changes investments geared towards renewable). Regardless, I don&#x27;t think it makes sense to talk about a &#x27;subsidy&#x27;, unless you&#x27;re having a chat with policy makers or economists. But in every day conversations with people, people don&#x27;t use the word subsidy this way.<p>Either way, that&#x27;s just a side note. The main point is this, it&#x27;s obvious that fossil subsidies are substantial, but how big are they relatively to renewable? A fair way to compare is to look at the amount of subsidy per unit of energy. And they&#x27;re gigantic for renewables.<p>For example:\n<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;timworstall&#x2F;2013&#x2F;11&#x2F;13&#x2F;renewables-get-25-times-the-subsidy-that-fossil-fuels-do&#x2F;#2715e4857a0b22eae2fdd373\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;timworstall&#x2F;2013&#x2F;11&#x2F;13&#x2F;renewable...</a><p>Regardless of whether those numbers are exactly right, most studies confirm this disparity, hell if you follow the industry you&#x27;ll find virtually all CEOs of all solar companies talk openly about this. e.g. the SolarCity CEO has a couple of entrepreneurship videos on youtube speaking to uni students about this. And that&#x27;s fine, understandable and acceptable. It&#x27;s obvious the world won&#x27;t sustain itself without renewables, it&#x27;s also obvious we have to hit some harsh deadlines, and that we couldn&#x27;t let the market create the financial incentives by itself to get the hundreds of billions of investments necessary to get a renewable industry running that has a chance of success. I support the ridiculously high subsidies, it&#x27;s the only way we&#x27;ll get there.","time":1452808460,"type":"comment"},{"by":"s_reid9","id":10904862,"parent":10852979,"text":"Yello has been added!","time":1452808478,"type":"comment"},{"by":"shmerl","id":10904860,"parent":10904671,"text":"It&#x27;s also annoying that Github sometimes is missing some basic features like attachments to bug reports and comments for instsance.

The changes serve to entirely reverse the tax grab on the sector in the Chancellor&#x27;s 2011 budget.&quot;<p>Or to put it another way, the UK taxes newer oil fields as 50%, which is a horrible subsidy compared to how they taxed it two years before that, but no change from how they taxed it before <i>that</i>.  And in general the UK has (even after the change) some of the highest taxes on petroleum production in Europe.<p>Question:  If the UK has above average tax rates, does that mean it has no subsidy at all?  Or is there some &quot;natural&quot; tax rate and any deviation from that is a subsidy?

The client you use doesn&#x27;t matter a bit.<p>2. Encrypting the traffic helps if an ISP is actively looking for torrenting, but they rarely do this. In fact, I suspect residential ISPs (Time Warner, Verizon, Comcast) absolutely never do this; university and corporate network administrators might. In part because it&#x27;s very time and effort consuming for them, but mostly because lots of people torrent perfectly legal things. People get caught because the MPAA, and other organizations, contract firms to write scripts and bots to crawl sites and hunt for as many trackers as possible, then monitor trackers and record all peers observed if they find a file that matches content they own. Encryption won&#x27;t do anything there. You can&#x27;t encrypt your IP address from a peer, obviously.<p>3. When you do it makes little difference. Your odds of getting caught may be a little higher in the first few days, but many people still get caught several years later. The cost of keeping these scripts on these trackers is merely the cost of a little bandwidth and electricity for them. They have no reason not to sit on a tracker forever.<p>4. You have it completely backwards. It&#x27;s the &quot;mafiaa&quot; who send the logs of what they found to your ISP. Then your ISP notifies you of the report they received. They don&#x27;t require any info from the ISP (unless they decide to later file a lawsuit and want the subscriber&#x27;s personal information). The burden of proof is on them to give what they have to your ISP.<p>I&#x27;ve dealt with many of these cases from the perspective of the ISP. None of these are secrets. Using a VPN to do something illegal is not remotely &quot;tinfoil hat&quot;.<p>Just use a VPN or a tracker you&#x27;re reasonably sure their bots can&#x27;t find. That&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s easy.

To get into Harvard, a teenager needs:<p>1) To know about Harvard and elite universities in general. Believe it or not, research shows that most qualified poor kids don&#x27;t apply because they don&#x27;t have any knowledge about the value of an elite education or that places like Harvard exist. Anecodotally, I know a couple of brilliant ones from poor backgrounds who went to their state universities simply because they had no idea there were other options - in fact, it was an imaginative stretch to go to college at all.<p>2) Family and community support for a college education, much less an expensive elite one far away. Sure, some super-teen can overcome this, but it&#x27;s a major reason kids don&#x27;t apply or drop out at high rates. My two friends were constantly asked, why would you want to go to college? Kids in these situations are in alien environments at college (that it seems perfectly normal to white middle-class kids should tell you exactly what environment it is) where they have few people who can relate to them (Edit: and an institution not built for their needs), then they go home and are asked why they are wasting their time and family&#x27;s money. And as they absorb university life, they also become alienated from people at home who don&#x27;t have those life experiences or opportunities.<p>3) Money: There is a very strong relationship between family money and college education.<p>4) An excellent high school education: Something else that correlates strongly with the family they come from.<p>5) Connections: It&#x27;s not what you know, but who you know. Do you think all those kids in Harvard are there on merit? What about the legacies? The big donors&#x27; kids? The kids with recommendations from alums?

In fact even allowing a simple JS Object to be used for setting properties in the creation step would be handy.<p>- Templating needs to be built in. Practically every single framework has its own way of templating and they all suck to a degree because you have to take the huge tradeoff of either doing the templating server-side, loading the HTML then replacing the values or loading the JS then generating the HTML. All of it is slow. A browser native solution could be orders of magnitude faster than dealing with the last two and makes it easier to leave the front end as purely static versus having some dynamically generated items.<p>- HTML and ECMAScript committees needs to get together and create clear separations of functionality between what the HTML and the ECMAScript standards provide. AJAX was great but this is an HTML standard; HTTP needs to be baked directly into the ECMAScript standard since JavaScript can run anywhere now. Eventing too needs to be moved from HTML standards (as far as the eventing itself is described; the events individual elements use most certainly should stay in the HTML standards) and build eventing right into ECMAScript. Right now node and the browser both provide their own event handling.<p>Obviously those items are far more nuanced than my real fast list but you asked me to give you answers to a hard problem :).

Internet Explorer, the king of browsers at the time, routinely exhibited totally unexpected behavior with little to no tools to discover how to fix things. While this may sound like a personal attack against Internet Explorer, it&#x27;s the truth of the matter. Other browsers had quirks, but none were as important as the quirks discovered in the most popular browser at the time.<p>The things that you wanted to start doing to make your app &quot;Web 2.0&quot; like transitions, CSS animations, AJAX behavior, big DOM manipulations, and so on, were totally <i>possible</i> with JS. You just had to write a <i>lot</i> of it and pray to whoever you wanted when you went to test it in IE.<p>One of the big catalysts for getting something better than vanilla JS to play with wasn&#x27;t just to make writing the code more pleasurable, it was to make it easier to GSD. Two camps came out in this regard. You had folks who were abstracting away the JS a lot more, creating more of their own syntax and language for everything; a framework built in JS. Then there were folks like jQuery who were creating what a lot of people considered a library, in that it felt like you were utilizing a lot of the same vanilla JS you knew and loved, but with some wrappers and helpers.<p>I mean, AJAX was a big and cool &quot;aha&quot; moment when you first saw it and played with it. But the first time you got to do things like:<p>* Identify an element without verbosity like document.getElementById()<p>* Attach an onclick to elements <i>reliably</i> and in a cross-browser safe way<p>* Change the color, replace some text, and fade in or shake or whatever was cool at the time in a <i>single</i> line of code that worked everywhere<p>... things like these were also very, very cool.<p>And because jQuery was well-documented, and didn&#x27;t change the language and feeling of using a lot of JavaScript too tremendously, it was, and continues to be, an invaluable tool in so many belts. There are tons of good libraries built on top of jQuery that continue to evolve with standards and trends.<p>Overall it&#x27;s stood the test of time well, and has saved countless hours of development time; two important qualities in great software.","time":1452805502,"type":"comment"},{"by":"glibgil","id":10904463,"parent":10903904,"text":"Fewer jobs, lower pay","time":1452805495,"type":"comment"},{"dead":true,"deleted":true,"id":10904449,"parent":10902661,"time":1452805291,"type":"comment"},{"by":"BinaryIdiot","id":10904448,"parent":10897671,"text":"&gt; Is it?

The data plate on the order station says it was made by &quot;Vitarama&quot;.  Vitarama was the company behind Cinerama.  Owned by the Rockefellers, it developed a range of unusual projection devices - projectors for spherical screens and elliptical screens, gunnery training simulators, and a range of slide changers.  Fred Waller, who invented Cinerama and worked for Vitarama, was probably involved. He had a patent for an addressable slide projector.[1] The shopping system used a linear tray rather than the circular tray shown in the Life article, but the selection by number is similar.<p>The idea wasn&#x27;t silly.  At the time, Sears and some other companies had catalog order centers, where customers could go and shop from catalogs.  This was an improvement on that concept.<p>The problem may have been the user interface.  It looks like you&#x27;d ask the attendant to load up a slide tray for the product area of interest, and then you could use a knob to select slides.  Each slide contained only one image. This makes for a small catalog.<p>They could have used a microfiche system and had a much larger catalog. But how to address it in a user-friendly way?  That&#x27;s a hard problem.  If you&#x27;ve ever used microfilm data, you&#x27;re aware of how hard it is to find anything.  Their UI had two buttons and a knob, probably the upper limit for shopping UI complexity in the 1950s.\nSome later microfilm systems had bar codes and some the ability to search, but that was a late 1960s development and required electronics.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com.ar&#x2F;patents&#x2F;US2732758\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com.ar&#x2F;patents&#x2F;US2732758</a>","time":1452805175,"type":"comment"},{"by":"chriskanan","id":10904441,"kids":[10904480,10907213],"parent":10904364,"text":"The problem is that many applicants don&#x27;t realize that.

Yes, the verbal, &quot;planning&quot; part of your brain has convinced itself, but it is also self-absorbed and treats the rest of the brain like its footstool.<p>For an example, &quot;I should lose weight&quot; is a ridiculously abstract concept to most of your brain. Your talky bit thinks it&#x27;s saying something concrete: &quot;Get that number on the scale down&quot;, but it hasn&#x27;t actually said enough. It&#x27;s a half-baked aspiration, not an activity. &quot;I should exercise&quot; is better: It prescribes an abstract activity that would accomplish the goal. It&#x27;s still terrible though because it&#x27;s still abstract. What is the value of exercise in the abstract? You don&#x27;t experience exercise in the abstract: how could you possibly judge whether it is rewarding or not? How can you decide to &quot;exercise&quot; when exercise isn&#x27;t even a real thing?<p>&quot;I should run&quot; is even better: You know how running feels. You can feel good running, and you can feel bad running. There are actual experiences and knowledge to draw upon to determine the value of running. Still: Not enough. Should you be running all the time? Verbal brain is being awfully sloppy, and has the gall to blame the rest of the brain for its mistakes. &quot;I should run tomorrow in the morning for 30 minutes when I wake up.&quot; And we have arrived at remedy #3 which is called implementation intention. Honestly, what other intentions are actually intentions? If you&#x27;re not planning concrete actions but abstract classes of actions, you&#x27;re daydreaming, not planning. Verbal brain likes to talk about how important obligations and commitments are, but avoids doing the work of translating its precious thoughts into something intelligible to the rest of the brain.<p>The verbal part of your brain is easily convinced: By its own words. It doesn&#x27;t even know what it has convinced itself of but it is awfully satisfied with itself. You, the ensemble of brain bits, are obviously skeptical of such a gullible entity. When you experience satisfaction or gratification for doing something, that is real knowledge to your brain; you learn what is good and what is bad. Of course you&#x27;re going to prefer real knowledge over the ravings of an imbecile about the great rewards of not-even-a-real-thing.","time":1452803968,"type":"comment"},{"deleted":true,"id":10904313,"parent":10903922,"time":1452804140,"type":"comment"},{"by":"zvrba","descendants":0,"id":10904289,"score":3,"time":1452803937,"title":"Uncovering the secret history of Myers-Briggs","type":"story","url":"http://digg.com/2015/myers-briggs-secret-history"},{"by":"blueatlas","id":10904316,"parent":10903376,"text":"Although an 8-bit CPU, I&#x27;ve always thought the PEP8 simulator [1] (Warford, Pepperdine) was nice in that it is a visual simulation of the CPU:<p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cslab.pepperdine.edu&#x2F;warford&#x2F;CSUploads&#x2F;Pep8CPUPaper.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cslab.pepperdine.edu&#x2F;warford&#x2F;CSUploads&#x2F;Pep8CPUPap...</a><p>EDIT: and if you want an absolutely wonderful series of lectures on computer systems, CPU architecture, assembly, etc., checkout Warfords free course on iTunesU [2]<p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunes.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;course&#x2F;computer-systems&#x2F;id546468937\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunes.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;course&#x2F;computer-systems&#x2F;id546468...</a>","time":1452804176,"type":"comment"},{"by":"stickfigure","id":10904308,"kids":[10904327,10905608,10907025],"parent":10903471,"text":"Strategy 5: Add a broken &#x2F;etc&#x2F;hosts entry for news.ycombinator.com","time":1452804051,"type":"comment"},{"by":"jarek","id":10904284,"parent":10904208,"text":"&gt; I do not hear the &quot;necessity is evil but we have to live with it&quot;.

From Wikipedia:<p>&quot;On March 13, 2013, Terry M. Dinan, senior advisor at the Congressional Budget Office, testified before the Subcommittee on Energy of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology in the U.S. House of Representatives that federal energy tax subsidies would cost $16.4 billion that fiscal year, broken down as follows:<p>Renewable energy: $7.3 billion (45 percent)\nEnergy efficiency: $4.8 billion (29 percent)\nFossil fuels: $3.2 billion (20 percent)\nNuclear energy: $1.1 billion (7 percent)&quot;<p>(If you add in more items than the CBO does, you&#x27;ll get different numbers, but this rapidly gets problematic.  For example, in the US, R&amp;D spending is not taxed, and can be deducted from gross revenue before calculating a tax bill.  For some people, that means that the US subsidizes R&amp;D for fossil fuel research, but since the US subsidies <i>all</i> R&amp;D, I don&#x27;t feel like this qualifies as a specific subsidy to fossil fuels.

There are problems with XMPP, but IMHO they&#x27;re more in how it is organized than in the protocol itself. XMPP has surveyed a huge chunk of the space, it has seen where things are difficult and proposed a solution for that. It is in use by many entities already, with many different use cases (one of the later extensions (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xmpp.org&#x2F;extensions&#x2F;xep-0365.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xmpp.org&#x2F;extensions&#x2F;xep-0365.html</a>) is to use XMPP over radios with atrocious conditions: latency in minutes, throughput as low as 75 bits&#x2F;s. Also, for some reason XMPP has seen some success in military), it has all the benefits of being an approved IETF protocol (one of which being that it will still be here in 10 years, whatever happens). Sure, it&#x27;s old stinky XML, but it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s a brand new technology where little documentation exists. There are libraries in most languages already.<p>What we really lack is a bit more guidance: the XSF (XMPP Standards Foundation) is only interested in making sure the standard is properly specified, that demands are met appropriately. It&#x27;s a huge huge job, but for a community of developer it&#x27;s not enough. There has already been talks to update the suite of extensions that are considered almost-mandatory in a modern IM software; it would also be really awesome to have a reference implementation for each usage (ie one server, one IM client, one VoIP client, one microblogging client, ...) because, like many others, I find tangible code we all agree on to be of very high value.<p>I fear that other protocols will be created, they will all (or at least a good part) die, and in the end we&#x27;ll have XMPP, standing there in the waves of protocols, chugging along quietly. People will be mocking it not because it doesn&#x27;t work, but because they don&#x27;t understand it (and that will be a fault with XMPP, not with people, because it will remain extremely complex)","time":1452803794,"type":"comment"},{"by":"treefire86","descendants":0,"id":10904279,"score":3,"time":1452803879,"title":"Are you a thirder or a halfer?","type":"story","url":"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20160114-sleeping-beautys-necker-cube-dilemma/"},{"by":"CurtHagenlocher","id":10904267,"parent":10898802,"text":"Interesting.

This is the only asset class with significantly above average gains for decades. It does go down once in a while but it comes roaring back in relatively short time. Even when dropping, it rarely goes below 25% protecting most of the principal. This is about the only item that had massive inflation in past 7 years.</i><p>This is incorrect. The median new house price in the US hit a pre-recession peak in March 2007 of $262,600. In Nov 2015, the price was $305,000. An investment in a theoretical &quot;median real estate&quot; fund would have returned 16.4% over the 7 year period. [1]<p>An investment in the S&amp;P500, say through SPY or the Vanguard ETF (if it had been available pre 2009) would have returned 27.9% over the same period, or 53.1% if you had reinvested your 5.0% annualized dividends. [2]<p>At a more granular level (using Zillow data) - the median housing price in San Francisco over the same period increased from $786k to $1.12m for a return of 42.4%. Cambridge, 47.0%. Manhattan, 66.6%.<p>San Diego? 3.5%. Boise? -12.6%. St. Louis? -22.9%. Detroit? -49.6%. Did you know that the median sales price of a house in Detroit is currently $38.4k?<p>---<p>&gt; <i>In economics, you can make anything a currency which cannot be manufactured easily and is available in quantity that is very hard to grow. Economists are puzzled why the tons of money poured in to system through QEs isn&#x27;t producing any inflation. I think QEs are indeed producing massive inflation but it all goes in to real estate. Funds like Blackstone eventually ends up with significant chunk of QE money and guess what is their major investment activity these days? The easy &quot;inexpensive&quot; money is the best way to inflate real estate.</i><p>Economists are (for the most part) in agreement that QE is not causing inflation due to a lack of aggregate demand. Here is an article [3] in which Brad DeLong (UC Berkeley, Keynesian-adherent) agrees with Joseph Stiglitz (Nobel Laureate, voted 4th &quot;most influential&quot; economist in the world today) when he makes the following assertion:<p><i>The economics of this inertia is easy to understand, and there are readily available remedies. The world faces a deficiency of aggregate demand, brought on by a combination of growing inequality and a mindless wave of fiscal austerity...The only cure for the world&#x27;s malaise is an increase in aggregate demand. Far-reaching redistribution of income would help, as would deep reform of our financial system -- not just to prevent it from imposing harm on the rest of us, but also to get banks and other financial institutions to do what they are supposed to do: match long-term savings to long-term investment needs.</i> [4]<p>---<p>What does this have to do with the higher real estate prices in urban centers? I believe that what is truly happening is that many are flocking to a decreasing number of cores (usually around universities that churn out well-educated but low-paid graduates) for fewer aggregate job opportunities in select sectors: finance, tech, entertainment, business services (consulting, HR, accounting, etc.), and services (food, drinks, nail salons, etc.). This has happened in a relatively short amount of time as the employment market is generally more fluid and less regulated than the housing market, which is restricted and regulated in the extreme in high-demand, high-price markets. It takes 2-3 years for an org to restructure its work force, but it takes decades to make meaningful changes to the way a city is built.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.census.gov&#x2F;construction&#x2F;nrs&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;uspricemon.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.census.gov&#x2F;construction&#x2F;nrs&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;uspricemon.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dqydj.net&#x2F;sp-500-return-calculator&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dqydj.net&#x2F;sp-500-return-calculator&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.huffingtonpost.com&#x2F;brad-delong&#x2F;global-economic-depression_b_8924596.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.huffingtonpost.com&#x2F;brad-delong&#x2F;global-economic-de...</a><p>[4] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.huffingtonpost.com&#x2F;joseph-e-stiglitz&#x2F;world-economy-2016_b_8908560.html?utm_hp_ref=world\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.huffingtonpost.com&#x2F;joseph-e-stiglitz&#x2F;world-econom...</a>","time":1452803991,"type":"comment"},{"by":"abcampbell","id":10904298,"parent":10903660,"text":"The premise is that you should consider your broad life portfolio, and with sufficient reflection, most people would probably want to diversify their life.

But it can be helpful to distinguish code from data and the same applies to containers vs data. On the few occasions when a conceptual distinction is <i>not</i> helpful, one should simply ignore the distinction. (This is perhaps somewhat like lisp macros that could be said to conceptually treat code as code or as data depending on whether or not it&#x27;s helpful to the human writer or reader to treat it one way or the other.)<p>&gt; A string is a container of characters<p>In Perl 6 a &quot;string&quot; is not a &quot;container&quot; even if you like to think of it that way and&#x2F;or use the words that way.<p>&gt; So should the window.Add(subWindow) method automatically loop over the subSubWindows of subWindow and add each of them as direct children of window, or should it simply add subWindow to window directly so its subSubWindows are grandchildren of window?<p>Exactly.

A business isn’t a bloodline. A business is a business, and anyone who treats it otherwise will be disappointed.&quot;<p>Totally agree.  This is a way to make it difficult to quit and guilt you into staying when things get rough.<p>&quot;If your company gets acquired for $30 million (good luck!), your 0.1% is worth $30,000 (at best). Acquired for $1 million? You get $1,000. Crash and burn? 0.1% of zero is zero.&quot;<p>The problem with numbers like this is that every situation is different.  A company that takes in tons of VC and is overvalued and then sold a few years later, will pay out to the VC first.<p>You also need to learn to read contracts (or get a lawyer to do it for you) and never sign something you don&#x27;t understand or want.

So far, they are copying the cable company strategy: license older content to get the viewers and then eventually create your own content to make more money.

This is the only asset class with significantly above average gains for decades. It does go down once in a while but it comes roaring back in relatively short time. Even when dropping, it rarely goes below 25% protecting most of the principal. This is about the only item that had massive inflation in past 7 years.<p>I think what is happening is real estate is becoming currency just like what gold was used to be. In economics, you can make anything a currency which cannot be manufactured easily and is available in quantity that is very hard to grow. Economists are puzzled why the tons of money poured in to system through QEs isn&#x27;t producing any inflation. I think QEs are indeed producing massive inflation but it all goes in to real estate. Funds like Blackstone eventually ends up with significant chunk of QE money and guess what is their major investment activity these days? The easy &quot;inexpensive&quot; money is the best way to inflate real estate. It&#x27;s a like you eat a lot but only your waist is accumulating all the fat and you wonder why your hands and feet remain so thin. I suspect this trend will continue because people are realizing real estate is more safer currency that can be relied upon as opposed to stocks or anything else. The safety is derived from the fact that, in worst case, it can be rented to generate better than interest returns or physically be used. This assumption can only be violated if interest rates grows a lot beyond rent income and thus in high inflation. However overall economic inflation cannot happen if all the surplus keeps landing in real estate.

To expound a bit...<p>There is a perspective&#x2F;philosophy* in which humans under anarchic&#x2F;natural-law are born with 100% rights. E.g., if you were washed ashore with a number of ship-wreck-mates on an otherwise uninhabited island, there&#x27;d be nothing to stop you from implementing works copyrighted in other lands. Further, there&#x27;d be nothing to stop you from violating the terms of any contract or even murdering anyone--you&#x27;d have unlimited rights.<p>But let&#x27;s say we&#x27;re wiser than that. When we wash ashore, we all agree that it&#x27;s in everyone&#x27;s best interest to avoid killing each-other. Therefore, we each give up a measure of our unlimited rights and grant them to each-other in the form of governmental &#x27;powers&#x27;--if someone kills one member of our new tribe, the other members will kill (or otherwise deprive the rights of) the one who initiated the aggression.<p>In it&#x27;s ideal form, the government&#x27;s purpose is to maintain the largest possible sphere of individual rights without allowing individuals to infringe upon the rights of others. It can only exist inasmuch as each individual condones and supports it&#x27;s actions. To the degree it becomes imbalanced towards one party or another, the aggrieved parties retain the right to withdraw the powers they&#x27;ve delegated--in extreme cases they may fight the other party&#x27;s government to reclaim their inalienable rights.<p>With this scenario in mind, imagine that you see me building a sand castle on my side of the beach. You like the design so you copy it on your side of the beach. I&#x27;m not flattered by the imitation but you haven&#x27;t really deprived me of any rights either--I&#x27;m still free to do as I wish on my side of the beach. Since I&#x27;m not really harmed, I don&#x27;t have an inalienable right to monopolize the castle&#x27;s design. In fact, if I storm over to your side of the beach and knock your copy down, I&#x27;d be depriving you of the right to make that kind of sand castle should you see fit to do so.<p>Given such a dispute, the tribe (including yourself) might agree to relinquish the right to manipulate sand in particular ways and create a new governmental power. The creation of this power appeases and incentivizes me to continue voluntarily beautifying the beach with fresh and innovative sculptures and promotes continued peaceful cooperation. This a matter of policy, there are no higher laws or anything set in stone about the validity or duration of my claims, etc.<p>* I tend to agree with this philosophy but want to take a more objective tack for the sake of the great-grandparent poster.","time":1452798568,"type":"comment"},{"deleted":true,"id":10903580,"parent":10903315,"time":1452798490,"type":"comment"},{"by":"brightball","id":10903577,"parent":10903404,"text":"Just checked and that doesn&#x27;t seem to be it for me.","time":1452798483,"type":"comment"},{"by":"themartorana","id":10903589,"parent":10903403,"text":"That&#x27;s a fantastic point.","time":1452798569,"type":"comment"},{"by":"ascendantlogic","id":10903583,"kids":[10904213,10904045],"parent":10902323,"text":"I assume Netflix would happily stream everything everywhere but the content producers that license the content want strict control over who sees what when.

At CES, Ted Sarandos (VP of Content) mentioned that traditional TV had to hit home runs all the time, while Netflix can score with singles, double, etc. Why would Netflix jeopardize this advantage and hop in the time machine to become an outdated TV company?<p>It sucks that House of Cards and some of the older original content (particularly the more popular titles) aren&#x27;t globally available, yet, but I believe (also from the CES talk), this was done because Netflix couldn&#x27;t afford the financial risk at the time (and&#x2F;or simply could not afford the global rights) for some of these shows. More recent&#x2F;upcoming shows are licensed globally, so there&#x27;s an apparent effort to ensure that Netflix moves to having a single global catalog.

And this problem is isomorphic to the problem where you have a freestanding function; i.e.<p>struct Foo {..}<p>impl Foo {\n fn handle(&amp;mut self, req: &amp;mut Request) {..}\n}<p>is isomorphic to<p>struct Foo {..}<p>fn handle(foo: &amp;mut Foo, req: &amp;mut Request) {..}<p>And of course it is. The handle function needs a `Foo` to store state or whatever. If it didn&#x27;t, you wouldn&#x27;t have implemented it as a method at all, you would have implemented it as a non-self function (`impl Foo {fn handle(req: &amp;mut Request)}`, which can also be passed directly as `Foo::handle`). Where would the Iron function get this receiver from? You have to pass the receiver down with the function, so you need a closure (anything which is callable and has an associated state, i.e. more than just a function pointer)<p>This has nothing to do with `self`. It has to do with the fact that <i>methods</i> need a <i>receiver</i>, which is a general fact of life with methods.<p>So your handler needs a receiver with some extra state that you&#x27;re using. You would need to pass down the receiver regardless, and the signature doesn&#x27;t support arbitrary receivers.<p>This is a problem in Rust and Python, as you correctly noted. It&#x27;s a worse problem in Java where the stdlib callable doesn&#x27;t even allow arguments, so you have to implement an interface (FWIW this solution is available to you in Rust too, either directly implementing `Fn(..)` or if Iron decides to accept a special trait instead), which is much more typing. PHP needs you to construct an array thing to make a callable closure, which is arguably just as &#x27;bad&#x27; as Java.<p>C# has type safe callbacks which allow you to specify arguments, however methods don&#x27;t work. You need additional boilerplate for it (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;4015451&#x2F;pass-a-method-as-a-parameter\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;4015451&#x2F;pass-a-method-as-...</a>)<p>C++ has function pointers, but methods don&#x27;t work as function pointers (since you still need there to be a closure under the hood, and C++ doesn&#x27;t do that kind of implicit stuff). C++ Concepts seems to have a &quot;Callable&quot; concept, but I didn&#x27;t look into whether or not it comes with auto-closureifying syntax.<p>So really the issue has nothing to do with `self` being used for method signatures, it has to do with whether or not `object.method` is automatically turned into a closure. Rust tries to avoid such magic, so it doesn&#x27;t have this feature. It could, with relative ease, <i>without getting rid of `self`</i>.<p>Two languages which do seem to do this are Javascript and Go. In Go (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.golang.org&#x2F;p&#x2F;jsKtkbD7vr\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.golang.org&#x2F;p&#x2F;jsKtkbD7vr</a>), `foo.handle` is automatically turned into a `func(*Request)`, which is even more magical, since IronRun expected a `func` and not an `interface Callable` or whatever.<p>Javascript does the same, `obj.handle` will auto-create a closure for you.<p>Yes, it would be slightly neater for Rust to auto-closure `obj.handle`, but this sounds a bit too magical for Rust (which tries to be low level and make costs explicit). This has nothing to do with `self`, and this isn&#x27;t a problem localized to Rust.","time":1452796611,"type":"comment"},{"by":"mathewvictor","dead":true,"id":10903357,"score":1,"time":1452796597,"title":"Free team password manager on CNET Cheapskate deals","type":"story","url":"http://www.cnet.com/news/get-a-portable-car-jump-starter-for-39-99/"},{"by":"gotchange","id":10903356,"kids":[10903546,10903411],"parent":10903286,"text":"The weak DOM API not JS was what plagued the early web period from 2000 - 2005.","time":1452796571,"type":"comment"},{"by":"peterwwillis","id":10903355,"parent":10901588,"text":"So, if there was forgotten code in OpenSSH (which, how the fuck does that happen?), where else might there be forgotten code?<p>Also: this is a really great example of why you should <i>never have undocumented features in your code</i>.","time":1452796547,"type":"comment"},{"dead":true,"deleted":true,"id":10903354,"time":1452796539,"type":"story"},{"by":"mtgx","id":10903353,"parent":10902938,"text":"Saudi Arabia must think that if it can only hold oil prices low for a few more years, its competition will be wiped out and then it can go on selling even more oil than it does now and for $100&#x2F;barrel, too.<p>It&#x27;s going to be in for a rude awakening in a few years when it tries that, because by then EVs will almost achieve critical mass, and once it tries to raise the prices, the EV sales will only accelerate.

Partly because it&#x27;s what I know, and partly because there&#x27;s never enough in the budget to to everything the client and I wanted to do with Cisco or even Juniper gear.<p>Now, admittedly, I&#x27;ve never worked on big networks. But, I know what I like, and I know working on a Cisco feels like 1996, and that working on a full-blown modern UNIX&#x2F;Linux system feels like home.

And, yet, a huge percentage of business networks that have real routers (rather than little wifi routers from LinkSys&#x2F;NetGear or whatever) have a Cisco of some sort, even when they don&#x27;t have anyone on staff who knows how to work the thing.

Whether there&#x27;s 10 users or 1M users that hour, it just handles what the back end gives it. Users won&#x27;t notice most optimizations. Heck, you can have a memory leak and most users won&#x27;t mind a couple crashes.

I believe that the drop in clean energy prices is what drove the crash in oil prices.<p>The reason the Saudis are trying to drive the frackers out of business is because the Saudis no longer believe that we&#x27;re going to get all the oil out of the ground before clean energy takes over. Previously they were fine cutting their own production in order to maintain a particular price because they were certain that eventually ALL of the oil in Saudi Arabia would get sold on the global market. If that took 100 years, that actually was even better for them. If you believed in peak oil, then being the last one standing with reserves actually would be awesome.<p>With clean energy beating projections it looks like we&#x27;re not going to burn every drop of oil in the Earth. Given that, the Saudis are no longer patient. If they hold back their reserves to maintain a particular price it&#x27;s very possible we&#x27;ll get off oil before we run out of oil. Thus the Saudis would have left money on the table if they didn&#x27;t shift strategy.<p>It seems like their new strategy is to extract every dollar they can for their oil reserves. In the short term that means fighting off the frackers, but the broader picture looks like a race to the bottom for all oil producers.<p>The good news is I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re going to burn all the oil on Earth.

I still decided not to buy more of my options, even at this new price, due to the aforementioned worries. The reason I bought 1 share is so that I can judge whether I made a mistake or not. I&#x27;m using this as a learning experience, whether I have good judgement for whether a company&#x27;s stock is worth anything. Friends of mine who were at the company years before I joined chose to forfeit their options which were in the $1&#x2F;share range, and mine were in the $30 range (after the repricing, they were $90+ before), and they&#x27;ll never really know if they left a good chunk of money behind or not.

Once when I was travelling I felt that except for sharing a photo on existing social networks (and adding a caption) or sending it as a message on messaging apps there isn&#x27;t a place online where I can go to specifically inspire my friends to travel to the place where I was. And that&#x27;s when the idea of Uggozi started taking shape. In Uggozi we bring the joyful experience of sending and receiving picture postcards to mobile.

One can become the &#x27;Uggozi explorer&#x27; of a geographical location by taking the first popular photo from anywhere in that geographical location.<p>Uggozi derives its name from the isiZulu word ugq!ozi which means collective inspiration and aptly defines our mission of making a community where travellers, explorers and dreamers can collectively inspire each other to explore this beautiful planet.

Almost no one burns petroleum for electricity mind you (nat gas, yes, but not oil) except Hawaii and parts of Alaska, and they&#x27;re moving as fast as possible to renewables because of price spikes that occur occasionally.<p>So you&#x27;re going to see this seesaw effect. Oil shoots up, more oil comes onto the market, oil goes back down, etc.<p>Renewables. Oh how I love me some renewables. There&#x27;s this legislation, the production tax credit [1]. It generously subsidizes the installation of renewables in the US. There&#x27;s always been this quagmire though, as Congress would only extend it 1 year at a time (hard to plan capital expenditures worth billions when the legislation you&#x27;re relying on is always up in the air).<p>But things changed in December of last year. At the end of 2015, in a landmark deal, Congress extended it for <i>5 years</i>, and in return, the US lifted export restrictions on crude oil. That means that solar and wind is going to roll out faster than ever. Natural gas will push out the remaining 30% of coal fired generation in the US, and wind and solar will fill the gaps (this is good; natural gas is cleaner, and produces much less CO2 per MWH produced). As more wind and solar comes online, along with utility scale battery storage, we&#x27;ll reduce our reliance on natural gas (protip: don&#x27;t invest long-term in generators who own substantial nat gas generation assets).<p>China is deploying wind at an astonishing rate, faster than even nuclear [2]. They&#x27;re heavily subsidizing electric vehicles now as well [3]. The price of coal is plummeting (which is good!) [4].

The terms &quot;use&quot; and &quot;sell&quot; speak to things you can sue for under a patent per United States Code title 35, section 271. The term &quot;sublicense&quot; is generic to licenses of all kinds, including copyright licenses and patent licenses.<p>3. There is also a legal idea called &quot;estoppel&quot; that prevents, broadly speaking, leading people to believe they can violate your rights freely and then suing them, or taking back or shrinking permission that you&#x27;ve already granted.

It gets dark, but so does Harry Potter, so fair game. I would say late grade school for the first book, adolescent for books 2 and 3.<p>Tamora Pierce has written a number of kid appropriate fantasy books with solid writing and strong female characters. I have seen countless grade school girls get hooked on her work. Some of her books just start to get into more mature relationship themes, but it&#x27;s enough to embarrass your kid a bit, not scar them.<p>As a child I enjoyed C.S. Lewis, but was personally affronted when I got to the last Narnia book and discovered that good story had been compromised for christian allegory. Lewis won&#x27;t make your child a bible thumped any more than Pullman will make them an atheist. Just make sure you know what your kid is reading, and find opportunities to discus the material with them critically!<p>Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s <i>Earthsea</i> series is another excellent option. I believe when I read it in grade school I found the pacing too slow, so I skipped ahead a lot and inferred a number of plot points. Nonetheless, I&#x27;m certain I enjoyed it the first time, it influenced my view of fantasy literature, and I have returned to reread the series multiple times since.<p><i>The Hobbit</i> is a great kids book.<p>Alison Croggon&#x27;s <i>Pellinor</i> series is less well known, but perfect for pre&#x2F;early teens that love fantasy.<p><i>The Enchanted Forest Chronicles</i> by Patricia Wrede feature a princess who runs away from home to work for a dragon. Solid writing, strong female characters, Pratchett-esque subversion of fantasy tropes. Fun and appropriate for grade school kids.<p><i>Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle</i> by Diana Wynne Jones<p>That&#x27;s off the top of my head.

I was also sweating profoundly and the pain was unbearable, yet I managed to just examine it, feel it, accept it.<p>I also remember having nightmares involving the meditation center - I clearly remember dreaming that building burning with huge flames and I was happy about it. It was a very vivid, colorful dream. My mind wanted to escape.<p>But then the most difficult part came. My wife was also in the group and we started being sexually attracted to each other starting with day 5 or so. \nThe inability to speak and even look at each other added to the sparks of desire that have been growing for 5 days of meditation, silence and abstinence.<p>By day 7 the attraction became electric - just a glimpse of her eyes revealed that she was feeling the same way - we were both fighting the sexual force ... Dreams became sexual...<p>We both fought the desire, but eventually we lost the battle - we ran away and had sex.<p>Although nobody has seen us, we felt like we cheated and we couldn&#x27;t continue the course.<p>So we told the teacher that we can&#x27;t stay anymore and she mentioned that usually they try to avoid married couples in the same course because of the sexual thing.<p>Another reason for bailing on day 7 was the feeling that I was being brainwashed into accepting this new religion&#x2F;sect&#x2F;whatever. The helpers definitely behaved very cultish and I didn&#x27;t want to become like them - I had a startup to run. \nSo my mind had this powerful argument - &quot;we&#x27;re being brainwashed, we have to escape&quot;.<p>Anyway, overall it was interesting, even though I haven&#x27;t achieved whatever I had to achieve on day 10, I think I learned a great deal of lessons about myself, about weakness, desire, love, etc.<p>If you have 10 days, go do it.","time":1452790358,"type":"comment"},{"by":"toddmorey","id":10902557,"kids":[10902761],"parent":10901691,"text":"That seem pretty atypical...

Especially in laptops, the increase of fragmentation and the correlated decrease in the performance of basically everything can be easily identified by the increased clicking and whirring noises coming from the disk (you may have noticed this on yours) - this is the heads thrashing around trying to read all that fragmented data spread around all over the disk.<p>Especially on older laptops, if the HDD has never been de-fragmented, it&#x27;s almost certain that this is your problem and is the performance bottleneck which has been getting tighter over time.

They focused more on (trying) to prevent pornography from reaching the delicate eyes of children, but still touched on liability issues.<p>Alternatives to the DMCA went somewhat like Encryption talks now: INCREASE liability, give the govt lots of controls, etc.  Sure the DMCA favors the copyright claimer, but if I&#x27;m a content host, you provide content, and I&#x27;m not liable.  Then someone complains, and I let you know.  You can dispute it, in which case I can keep it up without liability, or I can take it down.  Alternatives didn&#x27;t let it stay up, or would require that I prove your material isn&#x27;t infringing myself, or other such things that fell even more heavily on the copyright claimant-side.<p>I don&#x27;t think my perspective is all that unique - most of us that were around for the insanity that was CDA&#x2F;COPA watched the DMCA with interest and had a &quot;Well, this is progress&quot; attitude even though we didn&#x27;t really LIKE it, it was just a step in the right direction.<p>As for how to move forward, that&#x27;s a multi-part issue:<p>* The places where DMCA is inadequate need to chafe so people get it changed.  That&#x27;s been happening for years, mainly in areas of general public concern, such as cellphone unlocking, takedown abuse, and format shifting.<p>* attitudes about &quot;IP&quot; need to change.  That&#x27;s been happening, but more slowly.   I see non-legal people talking about IP as a wrapper for &quot;this setting and associated characters&quot; rather than &quot;copyright&#x2F;trademark&#x2F;patents&quot;.  News about patent trolls and related legal woes are becoming mainstream.<p>* One attitudes shift enough, the idea that &quot;I thought of this, I can deny anyone else similar thoughts while being heralded as a hero&quot; that currently drives copyright&#x2F;patent policy will become more nuanced and allow for the idea that the legal protections afforded are for the public benefit, not private benefit.<p>It&#x27;ll be slow going though.","time":1452789161,"type":"comment"},{"by":"wodenokoto","id":10902366,"kids":[10902713],"parent":10902187,"text":"I don&#x27;t think he is looking to execute the programs.

There&#x27;s plenty of anecdotal cases for it, just see the devastation of Detroit, for example.<p>As to your claim, throwaway as it may have been, here is why I think it to be wrong.<p>First of all, police, firefighters and other public services rarely use highways in urban areas. The reason for that is that urban highways are few in number due to their monumental construction costs, so each highway tends to be a few miles away from the nearest parallel highway. As a result, going from A to B in the same city is often faster on arterials than on highways for trips that are 6 miles or less, because the detour to access the highway is longer than the time gain from using it.<p>Second, highways do speed up longer distance travel, but how much of a benefit is it really? That depends on the kind of travel. As I wrote in the article, rural highways that connect regions together serve an important economic role by helping to speed up the transport of goods and people between them. However, commuting is quite a different beast, because with regards to commuting, there is a phenomenon called &quot;Marchetti&#x27;s constant&quot;, people tend to make choices of location for their residence and their workplace to maintain a commute time of roughly 30 minutes on average, because people understand distance as travel time, not as actual distance. So when you speed up travel inside a metropolitan area (from suburb to city&#x2F;other suburb), what you do is that you incite people to live further and further away from their workplace and from the stores they patronize.<p>Therefore, urban highways do not really lead to a reduction of commute times overall (some may have that benefit, but rarely is it generalized) but rather to an increase in distance driven. Which leads to more pollution (though often less concentrated), higher transport costs and a development pattern that makes transit non-viable, therefore forcing people to buy cars to access jobs and services.<p>An example of this is that in 1972, a study of commuting time and distance revealed that the average commuting time for people commuting 20-24 miles to work was 36 minutes, just 6 minutes more than for people commuting 11-14 miles. In other words, an increase of commute distance of 100% was associated by an increase in commute time of just 20%.\n<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nber.org&#x2F;chapters&#x2F;c8824.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nber.org&#x2F;chapters&#x2F;c8824.pdf</a> (table 6.7, page 19 of pdf)<p>So higher speed was correlated with longer commute distances AND with longer commute times. Correlation is not causation, but that should give people pause when they claim to want faster roads to reduce commute times.<p>So higher mode share for cars and greater distance traveled means more pollution, more wealth expanded just to provide transport (which consumption, like electricity, has no good in and of itself). That&#x27;s a drain on the economy.<p>Now, because I&#x27;m nice, I&#x27;ll give you one thing: highways allow cities farther away to become economically integrated, resulting in much bigger metro areas. Since much of the modern economy gains from concentrating people and resources in an economically integrated area, this may be seen as a positive. However, what we&#x27;ve seen in Asia and Europe is that in the absence of highways, metro areas can still be just as populous, concentrating as many people and resources in one economically-integrated region... that region just happens to be much more compact, often concentrated around train stations, with highways going around inhabited areas, connecting industrial areas, serving essentially for trips to and from other regions.","time":1452789086,"type":"comment"},{"by":"ionised","id":10902353,"parent":10894532,"text":"I commend you for your decision.","time":1452789083,"type":"comment"},{"by":"VSTeam","id":10902352,"parent":10895318,"text":"Hi jsingleton, just saw this post on your concerns about Visual Studio 2015.

It&#x27;s traditionally the job of the pilots in the plane to keep track of its position, meaning giving them GPS was more valuable than giving position information to the ground. The US is just getting to the point where air traffic control can get GPS from planes, and that is based on ground stations which won&#x27;t work over the ocean.<p>Which leads to the final issue, the outdated nature of the rocketry industry (and the intrinsic difficulty of getting to space), has made it very expensive to launch the satellites you need for worldwide communication. They exist, but they are much more expensive than any other way of communicating.

There is not actually a trade-off between quality and speed of delivery, especially not when you look medium- or long-term, but also not even in short-term. When you incentivize people to solve a problem in a high-quality way, they tend to also solve it faster and with fewer defects than when they are told to prioritize speed.<p>Also, none of this is nearly as binary as your comment makes it seem to be. Yes, you might lose a little in the short-term to a faster, but more error-prone, competitor. But as long as the loss isn&#x27;t so severe that you become insolvent, then you might live to see the day when all of the competitor&#x27;s errors and sloppy work come home to roost and they fail spectacularly. In general, doing it wrong but fast is pretty worthless, investors and customers will catch on to you and bail, and only the highest level of management will have insulated themselves from the losses that result.<p>Working for a steadier company that prioritizes building a name based upon actual quality, and is willing to tell customers or investors <i>no</i> when they must do so, to regulate feature creep, ensure high quality standards and accuracy, and so forth, is not only much more rewarding, but also more likely to lead to stable income.<p>I think the type of binary, winner-must-take-all-as-soon-as-possible thinking is very destructive.

As an lower-case atheist and non-religious person, I find it all incredible bleak and have been, over the years, working my way closer to the &quot;softer&quot; parts of Buddhism.  I&#x27;m pretty much an agnostic with maybe some weak spiritual views now and its a good place to be. I don&#x27;t think you can really expect Buddhists to strip Buddhism from meditation. They find too much value in it the same way I do.  Secular&#x2F;scientific &quot;stress busting&quot; techniques don&#x27;t work compared to holistic life changes that yes include weird spiritual stuff and counter-modern ideas like living for the moment&#x2F;experience and not giving into attachment, materialism, emotions, etc. We tried just deep breathing, we tried every psychological fad, we tried drugs, etc. They just don&#x27;t seem to work very well compared to a serious change in lifestyle as described by Buddhism or some school of mediation&#x2F;Eastern thought.<p>I see people stuck on endless skinner boxes on ipads and consoles. I see people fighting and killing themselves at shitty, stressful jobs (yours truly included), etc. I see conflict all the time and the inevitable race to a Nash equilibria that makes everyone unhappy. Samasara looks real to me, even if you interpret it as a metaphor. I don&#x27;t think its cultish to point out alternatives to the Western idea of &quot;being productive,&quot; or to add some &quot;woo.&quot; Frankly, I&#x27;m not convinced some &quot;woo&quot; isn&#x27;t real. No, I&#x27;m not sending money to Sylvia Brown, but I won&#x27;t be a dismissive asshole when people talk about reincarnation, or how they think Vipassana or Kundalini brought them close to some important spiritual experience, etc.  Funny how we dismiss these experiences, but ask any geek about LSD and he&#x27;ll ramble one for hours how its pretty much spiritualism in a can and everyone nods in lockstep. Perhaps we&#x27;re a little too dismissive of the soft parts of Buddhism in the West.","time":1452785146,"type":"comment"},{"by":"nickjj","id":10901906,"kids":[10902016],"parent":10901691,"text":"I think the markdown-preview plugin may have issues because once I get to about a 400-500 line file it pegs my i5 at 100% CPU and takes 5-6 real life seconds to enter a single character.<p>This is on Linux.

Whether that suits your use case or not is very much up to you.<p>That is still true. Of course, the implementation has been reviewed and beat on in production use more now than it had been in 2013, but the fact remains that there has been no systematic, independent outside audit focused specifically on cryptography. On the other hand, the cascade of &quot;interesting&quot; bugs since 2013 like Goto Fail and Heartbleed suggests that maybe the other implementations are not quite as audited as one might have expected.<p>As tptacek mentioned in another comment, Adam Langley is the primary author and maintainer for Go&#x27;s crypto packages. He&#x27;s also one of the key people involved in Chrome&#x27;s TLS implementation and Google&#x27;s use of TLS more broadly, and he&#x27;s a significant committer to OpenSSL and the creator and maintainer of BoringSSL. You can learn more about his work at his blog, imperialviolet.org. Having Adam involved with Go&#x27;s crypto&#x2F;tls raises my comfort level considerably. It&#x27;s not Joe Random (or Jane Random) working on the crypto code, as others suggested below. Even so, even experts make mistakes and it would be nice to get a second expert to go through it looking for problems.<p>For the most part Google does not use Go&#x27;s crypto&#x2F;tls for user-facing traffic. That is primarily a detail of Google&#x27;s pre-existing serving architecture (we use separate servers to do that, much like putting nginx in front of your main server, and many engineering years of work went into those servers before Go even started). Because of that, Google has not really evaluated Go&#x27;s crypto&#x2F;tls one way or the other for that use. I believe we do run Go&#x27;s crypto&#x2F;tls to serve HTTPS on godoc.org, although I&#x27;d have to double-check. I certainly run it on swtch.com, rsc.io, and so on, not that there are real secrets in any of those servers.<p>I suspect the largest production user of Go&#x27;s crypto&#x2F;tls is CloudFlare. Maybe someone from there can say something about their comfort level or exposure.<p>Like Andrew said, it&#x27;s really up to the provider of the service to make the call.

The problem is that the value that can be extracted is bounded by my actual problems. Nest can&#x27;t fundamentally transform my house heating experience into some sort of delight; at the absolute limit, all it could possibly do is cut my heating bill down to $0. Which would be amazing, but it can&#x27;t do that, of course.<p>Other IoT possibilities I see tossed about have even worse possibilities; Nest is probably already the biggest possible winner. If you eliminate 100% of the time I spend turning lights on and off, you&#x27;ve basically had no impact on my life. If you design a glorious IoT refrigerator that somehow requires 0 <i>additional</i> time out of my life to feed it data (which is a negative) it still has to face up to the fact that my &quot;display&quot; showing me what I have which I can get to by simply opening the door is superior to any practical front-mounted display. There&#x27;s very little room for any sort of IoT water-use optimizer, certainly nothing a startup could wedge into and make money. What can the IoT do for my washer and dryer, play tunes off of Pandora while I&#x27;m loading them? My cell can already do that.<p>I don&#x27;t need an Internet of Things. I need a Robot of doing Things, and if it&#x27;s hooked up to the internet I rather expect we&#x27;ll still see it as &quot;a robot&quot; rather than &quot;an IoT device&quot;.

(I&#x27;m down on IoT <i>security</i> in general, but that&#x27;s a separate problem. Sort of. Close enough for now anyhow.) It just seems to me that the vast bulk of the IoT story involves being not physically proximal to the IoT device (and, indeed, note how the core Nest use case of &quot;turning off the heat <i>when you are not there</i>&quot; fits that to a T), and therefore, unless you live in a mansion, it&#x27;s solving a problem a homeowner mostly doesn&#x27;t have.","time":1452784747,"type":"comment"},{"by":"ryanlol","id":10901862,"parent":10901848,"text":"Tested quickly, doesn&#x27;t look like it.

Unlike Windows software which generally runs on a very wide range of versions, most Mac apps assume users are only running more recent releases.  For example, Firefox runs Windows versions up to 14 years ago (Windows XP, which isn&#x27;t even supported by Microsoft any more) but only on Mac OS X within the last 6 years (OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard).  Couple that with the fact that it is very difficult to determine when Apple drops support for a given version of OS X because they have no published schedule and don&#x27;t officially announce when they drop support of a specific version.  In short, the equivalent 2008 Windows laptop is still getting security updates for the OS it came with, works with nearly all major Windows software, and can be updated to the latest version of Windows without much fuss.  The 2008 Macbook is running an unsupported version of OS X, can&#x27;t be upgraded to the current version of OS X, and can&#x27;t run quite a lot of Mac software.<p>Windows vs Mac resale value plays a lot into the way Windows folks use their laptops.  The reason is that they generally use a given laptop until they no longer need it.  My girlfriend&#x27;s laptop will be 5 years old this year and was purchased for about the same amount of money it cost you to use your Macbook for 3 years.  I spent another ~US$100 to upgrade to an SSD recently which will give it quite a bit more life.  And it can be upgraded to Windows 10 for free if we want to at some point. Granted, it&#x27;s only used for web browsing, office suite stuff, watching videos, recording and editing voice-over work etc, so it doesn&#x27;t need to be the latest and greatest.  So, it&#x27;s really more a different use case.<p>Your typical pattern of buy and sell is kind of fascinating to me as a Windows user, but makes complete sense given the comparable markets and models.  The wider array of Windows laptop choices in different budgets accounts for the lower resale value of higher end Windows laptops. Most users are fine spending $400 or less on a Windows laptop for the basic browsing, email, photos, videos, etc needs.  High end Windows laptop users want a new machine, not a used one.  So, there&#x27;s not much interest in $500 used Windows laptops... they don&#x27;t serve either market segment well.  In Mac-land, there is no $400-500 Mac laptop option, so anyone with only that budget has to look at used models.

You just want to make sure that they respect your role.<p>For example, one company has sales, marketing (separate from sales), finance, operations. Operations is then split into logistics, IT. Product development is squished under IT. This is likely a bad company for engineers. Likewise, I&#x27;ve seen companies where at least 50% of the budget is engineering.<p>3. What is the value of your role? If you make $100k, how are you contributing $200k to your company annually?

You switch between them a lot. As far I can tell, the resolution of both Oculus and HTC Vive isn’t suited for editing larger texts or tables efficiently.<p>Time (or better the VR industry) will solve this issue, but even then I’d argue many engineers prefer hand drawn sketches to support their thinking or for communicating ideas with their colleagues.<p>While I’m sceptic concerning the use of VR for every day engineering, I believe it will be fantastic to let non-engineers explore designs.

This is also true if you worked at a place that is small, but not a startup.<p>The best decision I made in my career was to ride the 2003 recession in a small catalog company that wrote its own code and wanted to grow. Since they were that small, I had responsibilities that had nothing to do with what people of my experience had to do in big companies.  I was making stack and architectural decisions quickly. Since we didn&#x27;t have an army of people, I had to do infrastructure, project proposals, requirements gathering, database administration, and decisions on stack changes. We just couldn&#x27;t afford specialists. My pay was not exactly competitive, but when I left for a bigger company, I had major advantages over my coworkers, because I had such a breadth of experience compared to them, pigeonholed in roles that did a lot less, and never had to care about what was good for the business, just doing what the next guy in the totem pole said. Your idea of big bucks might be different from mine, but making over 300k in the Midwest sounds pretty good to me.<p>And it&#x27;s not just my story: The rest of the people in that team are all doing extremely well. One is a senior architect in a cloud provider. Another is a pretty big conference speaker. The last one is the top technical gun in a consulting firm. All my friends that didn&#x27;t take risks to go for better experience are doing far less interesting work, for far less money.<p>That said, a startup just makes it easier to get a job that teaches the right things. If all you end up doing is writing a web app in Rails, you might as well do that in a bigger place that pays better. It&#x27;s not really about the office being cool, or thinking the company has a good chance at making it, but about finding ways to get a competitive advantage over other developers for the long haul.","time":1452782747,"type":"comment"},{"by":"digi_owl","id":10901644,"kids":[10910196],"parent":10886290,"text":"well damn, i missed that one...","time":1452782737,"type":"comment"},{"by":"woah","id":10901643,"kids":[10901739],"parent":10901054,"text":"Is it actually 10x faster than React?

A point and shoot parabola is the general case.<p>Parabolas fold and unfold well even when constructed from many parts because a lot of the parts are the same sku.

It so happens that the 60s also gave us the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, the Beatles, Yes, Genesis, and so on, but it&#x27;s <i>so easy</i> to take what we like from that era and remember only that.<p>The era of the 2000s that Bowie says is not subversive also gave us innovation in music and other art. The same thing can be said even of this year. Music might have been <i>a dominant</i> means of novel creative expression in the 60s (although television was in a massive ascendancy, and the Beat poets and investigative journalism were also hugely influential in other areas), but it was no more subversive then than it is today when you consider NiN, Skrillex, and the constant innovation in indie rock and EDM.<p>The reason the Internet might have been considered &quot;subversive&quot; by this article in the 2000s (and music less so) is that it was on the boundary between innovation and mainstream, as was Bowie&#x27;s brand of music in the 60s and 70s. It&#x27;s nothing to do with authority and everything to do with a new generation creating something without heeding the status quo, without sticking within the established norms.<p><i>This</i>, if anything, is what the article describes. Not subversion, but innovation beyond the established norms. When someone in their late teens or early twenties starts creating, they often do so by solving problems in new ways that are not based on existing solutions or patterns, and sometimes that act of creation from relative ignorance creates entirely new norms.<p>Applying that thought to now: The Internet is now mainstream, but the innovation that has not yet become mainstream is that which is controversial, that which laws and regulations have not yet caught up with. Social media and social content platforms (Instagram, Youtube, Facebook, Twitter) started in an era where they didn&#x27;t have to deal with trolls until they arrived, which meant they could do the fun stuff first and <i>then</i> raise the bar as the bad parts of society (griefers, regulations, nannying) caught up. A new platform in the same space has to reach <i>that</i> bar to <i>get started</i>. Topics that are currently in that space between innovation and mainstream acceptance (hence regulation and nannying) might include privacy&#x2F;encryption, P2P, geographical presence sharing and decoupling, piracy, gender&#x2F;sexuality issues, drug taking and distribution, or any of a number of other things that create tension due to being innovated faster than the status quo can keep up.<p>Some of those things look &quot;subversive&quot; in the classical sense, but in reality it&#x27;s technology moving at the leading edge of society and society catching up, rather than anything to do with authority.","time":1452777306,"type":"comment"},{"by":"ajuc","id":10901138,"parent":10900595,"text":"This could be very useful for optimizing 3d videogames :) Basicaly rendering only part of screen each frame.","time":1452777289,"type":"comment"},{"by":"rubberstamp","id":10901137,"parent":10900906,"text":"We(as in humans) have engineered a lot of things.

Kudos to you for trying. You&#x27;re on the right path. Some things you said that I like:<p>- You want to help your colleagues improve and get better. That&#x27;s great, both for your team, and for their own development.<p>- You&#x27;re asking for feedback, and retrospecting, in order to be a better leader. This will surely help you improve in the long run.<p>- You care about the fact that they (potentially) dislike you. This shows that you have a genuine interest in being a good leader&#x2F;colleague, which will go a long way.<p>Some suggestions and things to consider:<p>- How do your interactions with your colleagues generally go? Do you make efforts to interact with them on a social level, or is it purely professional? Do you ask them how things their weekends went, what they did over the holidays, how their families are doing? Such topics can indeed be woefully cliched, but at least they will know that you&#x27;re making an effort to connect with them as people, and not just as code monkeys.<p>- When you&#x27;re &quot;educating&quot; them on various topics, do you allow for the possibility that your advice may actually be wrong? Do you encourage them to push back if they disagree with you, or do you expect them to follow your advice without question? When someone does disagree with your advice, do you encourage discussion and get into the merits of the arguments, or do you (subconsciously) pull rank and close off the discussion? If someone does present you with better arguments as to why they are right and you&#x27;re wrong, do you compliment them and admit that they are right? Do you pout about the fact that you just &quot;lost&quot;, or the fact that they questioned you? Do you pull rank and demand that they do what you say, despite them having better arguments?<p>- What percentage of your feedback to them is compliments, as opposed to constructive criticism? Do you only give feedback when you want them to do something differently? Or do you also regularly give them feedback about the things that they are doing well? Notice how at the top of this post, I included a couple of things I liked about what you posted. People are much more open to suggestions for improvement, if you also give them genuine compliments about the things they are doing well.<p>- No matter how hard you try, you will never be one of the guys. Because you hold power over others, some of them will try to suck up to you, some of them will be intimidated by you, some of them will resent you, and some will do a mix of all 3. Being &quot;liked&quot; is a reasonable metric to look at, but also look at broader metrics beyond that. Do people enjoy the work environment in your team? Is your retention rate better or worse than comparable teams&#x2F;companies? Are people improving in their skills as engineers? Are people coming up with ideas of their own, and having earnest discussions about the best way to do things, or are they sitting back and just passively following orders? These are all far more important than you being liked. In fact, if you try too hard to be liked, and people pick up on that, they will even respect you less for it. It&#x27;s better to be a firm, fair and friendly leader, than to be someone who bends backwards to be liked.","time":1452777272,"type":"comment"},{"by":"Friendlyhacks","dead":true,"id":10901134,"score":1,"time":1452777218,"title":"Download Free Temple Run 2 Hack 2016 Android-IOS No Survey","type":"story","url":"http://goo.gl/6Gn8Pm"},{"by":"addicted","id":10901133,"parent":10897261,"text":"Didn&#x27;t  JavaScript already have a reference spec going back at least a decade?

Then every time you do a revision of the software, you deploy it to all the hardware, and you test it one at a time on every one of the routers. Customer&#x27;s having problems with hardware so old you can&#x27;t get it for your lab? Ask the customer for theirs, and offer them something better in trade.<p>You do the same with furnaces - although you probably need many fewer units in your test lab because the interfaces are a lot simpler.<p>The main reason not to do this is cost - a company might think spending $200,000 on a test lab has lower returns than spending that money on adverts or product discounts.","time":1452776166,"type":"comment"},{"by":"baldfat","id":10901044,"parent":10896901,"text":"Now I have a new example to show AWK as a language.

A few things you can do:<p>- Did you have any other manager during your time there? What about a senior tech lead&#x2F;architect who could arguable be considered as your &quot;technical manager&quot;? Try asking them. Even if they now work for a different company, that&#x27;s still fine. There&#x27;s no reason to limit yourself to the one manager who&#x27;s unresponsive.<p>- Ask your friends&#x2F;colleagues in the company to send your manager a friendly reminder. Your manager may not care about you, but at least he&#x27;ll care about not looking like a jerk in front of his colleagues and subordinates.<p>- Start going further up the food chain. Email anyone and everyone who was managing you, even indirectly, and ask them for such a letter. Ask your 2nd level manager, your department head, your division head, the VP, and even the CEO. As long as they managed you indirectly while you were there, their letter should be valid as well.<p>- Very similar to above, start putting social pressure on your manager to respond. Email your manager&#x27;s current manager, explain your plight, and ask him if he could help. Mention that you haven&#x27;t been able to get in touch with your manager (name him), but don&#x27;t say anything else that&#x27;s negative. People are generally more receptive to positively worded requests. If emailing your manager&#x27;s manager doesn&#x27;t get any response, try your department head. Then the division head. Then the VP... Email their secretaries as well, to ensure that someone else reminds them about the email. At some point, if your manager starts getting emails from people higher up the food chain asking him to help you out, he&#x27;ll agree to do so just to avoid looking like a jerk.<p>The above steps are to be used sequentially and judiciously. Try the least threatening approaches first, and only if it fails, move on to something slightly more threatening.<p>Remember that your manager has something you want (a verification letter), but you have something he cares about as well: the power to embarrass him and expose him as a jerk. Your goal is to use this power in the slightest and mildest way possible, with the implication that a progressively stronger application is coming in the future if he doesn&#x27;t respond nicely.","time":1452775649,"type":"comment"},{"by":"pc86","id":10901003,"kids":[10901414,10901108],"parent":10899705,"text":"&gt; <i>I achieved momentary clarity on the 8th day which helped me get rid of some of unnecessary but deep rooted complexes of my mind.</i><p>Can someone with experience in meditation explain what this actually means?","time":1452775644,"type":"comment"},{"by":"mikeash","id":10901002,"kids":[10901117],"parent":10900357,"text":"Albuquerque is a pretty tenuous example.<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t know.

Shawn Otto of sciencedebate.org covers this in his book on politics and science, &quot;Fool Me Twice&quot; (apologies for the typos from my book-scanner):<p><i>...it has long been the prevailing opinion that American suburbs developed as a result of the increased use of the car, GI Bill funded home construction, and white flight from desegregated schools after the 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka. But in reality the trend had started several years before Brown.</i><p><i>In 1945, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists began advocating for &quot;dispersal,&quot; or &quot;defense through decentralization&quot; as the only realistic defense against nuclear weapons, and the federal government realized this was an important strategic move. Most city planners agreed, and America adopted a completely new way of life, one that was different from anything that had come before, by directing all new construction &quot;away from congested central areas to their outer fringes and suburbs in low-density continuous development,&quot; and &quot;the prevention of the metropolitan core&#x27;s further spread by directing new construction into small, widely spaced satellite towns.&quot;</i><p><i>Nuclear safety measures drove the beginning of the abandonment of our cities. After being told that &quot;there is no doubt about it: if you live within a few miles of where one of these bombs strike, you&#x27;ll die&quot; and &quot;We can always hope that man will never use such a weapon but we should also adopt the Boy Scout slogan: Be prepared,&quot; getting far enough out of the &quot;target&quot; city so that the blast might be survivable seemed wise. Those who could afford to left. Those who remained were generally less affluent, and minorities made up a disproportionate share of the poor.</i><p><i>A far worse development for minorities in America came in 1954, when the federal Atomic Energy Commission realized that with the advent of the vastly more powerful hydrogen bomb, &quot;the present national dispersion policy is inadequate in view of existing thermonuclear weapons effects.&quot; But by then it was too late; the suburbs were growing, but offices were still by and large downtown. A new strategy was needed. President Dwight D. Eisenhower instead promoted a program of rapid evacuation to rural regions. As a civil defense official who served from 1953 to 1957 explained, the focus changed &quot;from &#x27;Duck and Cover&#x27; to &#x27;Run Like Hell.&#x27;&quot;</i><p><i>Cities across America ran nuclear attack drills, each involving tens of thousands of residents, practicing clearing hundreds of city blocks in the shortest possible time.^° It became clear that this would require massive new transportation arteries in and out of cities. The resulting National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956 was the largest public works project in history. It created a system that provided easier access from the suburbs into cities as well as a way to more rapidly evacuate cities in case of nuclear war. The new freeways had to be built in a hurry and were naturally routed through the cheapest real estate, which usually meant plowing through richly tapestried and vibrant minority communities, displacing millions. Although poverty had been concentrated in these very neighborhoods, their destruction ripped apart the social fabric of America&#x27;s uprooted minority communities for years, destroying social support networks and leading to a generation of urban refugee.</i><p><i>These accommodations for defense brought about an immense change in the fabric of America, altering everything from transportation to land development to race relations to modern energy use and the extraordinary public sums that are spent on building and maintaining roads— creating challenges and burdens that are with us today, all because of science and the bomb.</i><p>Otto&#x27;s Book:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;books.google.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;about&#x2F;Fool_Me_Twice.html?id=6pMqCjVynG0C\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;books.google.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;about&#x2F;Fool_Me_Twice.html?id=6...</a><p>More quotes from the book:<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mxplx.com&#x2F;Reference&#x2F;id=1284\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mxplx.com&#x2F;Reference&#x2F;id=1284</a>","time":1452775058,"type":"comment"},{"by":"raiken1","id":10900966,"parent":10900871,"text":"I can&#x27;t believe this isn&#x27;t a native Netflix browse option.\nYou just made Netflix even more valuable to me.","time":1452775024,"type":"comment"},{"by":"brudgers","id":10900965,"parent":10900189,"text":"That makes sense.

A similar argument applies to any shift towards more space-efficient modes of transport for passengers.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t quite see the argument on emergency services. Inner city highways&#x2F;motorways are mostly for moving from the centre into and out of the suburbs. Emergency services need to go from any random point to the nearest hospital, which is a different thing. Sending hundreds of thousands of highly space inefficient cars into city centres (which have a fundamental limit on street space, and their capacity to handle traffic) is highly likely to increase congestion and make it more difficult, not less difficult, to move around on the surface streets from one point to another in the centre. You&#x27;d have to introduce some congestion charging system, or perhaps bus lanes, otherwise building the road is likely to make the situation worse.<p>Where highways really shine is in moving goods into and out of cities. If you have high-volume industry in the centre of a city, or for instance a port, you clearly need some way of getting the inputs and outputs into and out of the city. But there does seem to be a continuous, long standing trend of moving this kind of infrastructure out of city centres. Modern container ports and factories need greater economies of scale, and tend to be situated on the outskirts of, or outside, cities where land is cheaper. And Western economies are moving more towards services rather than manufacturing. A big part of this debate is about what a city is for, and how to reconcile that with changes in transport and industry.","time":1452774405,"type":"comment"},{"by":"ourmandave","descendants":0,"id":10900863,"score":1,"time":1452773300,"title":"What's the Most Powerful Weapon in Sci-Fi History?","type":"story","url":"http://sploid.gizmodo.com/infographic-whats-the-most-powerful-weapon-in-sci-fi-h-1752668596"},{"by":"csomar","id":10900862,"kids":[10902354],"parent":10896611,"text":"Is it me or the author is simply making assumptions based on his &quot;intelligent point of view&quot;.<p>Here is my version: Urban highways create unparalleled amounts of wealth.

So you’re looking at a painting, glance away to another room, and look back to find a new painting hanging on the wall.<p>Re this comment. There is this thing called &quot;saccadic masking&quot;, the gist of which is that we are effectively blind while our eyes move from focusing on one position to the next. Depending on the &quot;distance&quot; (angle) traveled by the eye, this can last up to tens of milliseconds. Enough time to do some cool stuff!<p>One of the studies that conclusively showed this effect, a fairly long time ago, had participants wear some elaborate headgear that allowed the researchers to track where the eyes of their participants were looking at. They had them look at a standard sentence like<p>&quot;the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog&quot;,<p>but with a twist! Every word in the sentence was masked, except for the word the participant would be focusing on at that moment. So if he focused on the word fox, the screen would show<p>&quot;xxx xxxxx xxxxx fox xxxxxx xxxx xxx xxxx xxx&quot;.<p>Whenever the system detected a saccade by the eyes, they would recalculate which word the participant would be looking at (e.g. switch to dog), and changed the display of the screen accordingly, now showing<p>&quot;xxx xxxxx xxxxx xxx xxxxxx xxxx xxx xxxx dog&quot;<p>Participants were asked if they noticed anything strange about the sentence, but they reported there was nothing strange about it! (Disregarding having a heavy set of mirrors strapped to your head).<p>My point: If you were able to detect saccades of the eyes, and relatively accurately calculate their position, you could  have the region of the image that&#x27;s unattended be colourful noise, the theory says that your visitors would be none the wiser (of course this would break down with multiple people looking at the same image)<p>Even cooler: procedurally re-generate parts of the image that are unattended, so that you&#x27;re looking at an ever shifting image, but wouldn&#x27;t quite be able to pin down what&#x27;s happening.

All offer the same thorough, intellectual approach, but while much of what volumes 1&#x2F;3 say is useful for a modern programmer (but not for a modern &lt;language&gt; programmer), what I learned in volume 2 hasn&#x27;t been of much use to me. Today&#x27;s languages and libraries offer both math and data structures. But in practice, for whatever reasons, they seem to have liberated me effectively from caring about seminumerical algorithms, while I still think about data structures every week.<p>Knuth writes about making things fast with drum memory. I don&#x27;t have drum memory, but making my data structures fast within the real-world constraints remains a topic, and somehow it&#x27;s the same topic. Knuth also writes forty pages about floating point, but when I use floating point I don&#x27;t worry about that part in the same way. The libraries do what I need and their internal problems rarely or never leak up to me. (Well, at work we do occasionally share &quot;14.000000000002%&quot; of revenue... but it&#x27;s not a problem.

It&#x27;s also abundantly clear there are at <i>least</i> several hundred thousand people who are similarly dissatisfied with the Federal government. If there are no real barriers to emigration via formation of a new Nation-State (however small) within the borders of the old, then the chronically dissatisfied, immensely stupid, and&#x2F;or foolishly impassioned will be sure to do just that at the slightest provocation.<p>The thing about a Federation of States is that the group gains a <i>lot</i> of strength and stability if its member states are in it for good.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s not something I can answer for you in five minutes right now...<p>Oh sure. I didn&#x27;t expect an <i>immediate</i> answer to the question. I <i>do</i> hope you get back to me on this, though. :)<p>&gt; ...Switzerland tops many charts and it actually employs direct democracy.<p>There are a couple of things to note here:<p>* Despite Switzerland&#x27;s &quot;direct democracy&quot;, you don&#x27;t consider it a shining example of a government that is well run. (I didn&#x27;t expect that you would, I&#x27;m just noting it. :) )<p>* This &quot;direct democracy&quot; has -presumably elected- intermediaries, and (from what I gather) the vast majority of federal actions don&#x27;t originate from the citizenry, and the <i>majority</i> of the <i>real</i> discussion that goes into shaping them is not open to the public. [0]<p>* The Swiss people must <i>not</i> be voting to decide even a <i>tiny</i> portion of what the Swiss government does. From Wikipedia: &quot;Between January 1995 and June 2005, Swiss citizens voted 31 times, on 103 federal questions besides many more cantonal and municipal questions.&quot; That&#x27;s three votes per year, on ten issues per year. I&#x27;m fairly certain that there is <i>no</i> state in the US that does so little. [1] I don&#x27;t believe for a <i>second</i> that the Swiss people <i>truly</i> consider a significant fraction of the acts of their Federal government.<p>* The percentage of the population required to bring up an issue for reconsideration by the citizenry appears to be just over %1. [0] Coincidence?!? ;)<p>&gt; That last issue could be addressed by liquid democracy...<p>How do you prevent the tyranny of the majority when any given government -or even a <i>portion of a governed population</i>- can splinter at a whim? How do you address the manipulation of voters to act against their best interests when <i>everyone</i>, regardless of understanding or expertise on the matter at hand has an equal say in how to address a matter at issue?<p>If your answer to that last one is &quot;weight votes based on a person&#x27;s understanding and knowledge on an issue&quot;, (as you mentioned in your comment) then my question is &quot;How -exactly- do you plan to do this?&quot;.<p>Any reliable method will take <i>substantially</i> more effort than the vast majority of a given population will be willing to spend, [2] and <i>many</i> people are <i>sure</i> to disagree with an evaluation that means that their voting power on an issue they care about is less than a fellow citizen with whom they disagree. This gets even <i>more</i> complicated when such a person exercises their option to perform zero-effort secession.<p>Moreover, doing the research required to arrive at a suitable solution for real-world issues is <i>really tough</i>, and often <i>very time consuming</i>. I spent an hour or so digging around for those stats in my opening comment. I&#x27;ve spent probably another hour or two reading your comments and typing up all of <i>my</i> comments. This is all to kinda-<i>vaguely</i>-address <i>one</i> issue at a <i>really</i> high level! <i>Real</i> issues take days, months, or years of dedicated study to understand and come to an informed decision on.

I&#x27;m pretty sure the wikipedia page implicitly assumes that pirates are superrational (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Superrationality\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Superrationality</a>).<p>A group of superrational players may choose an outcome which is not even a NE! For example, two superrational players playing the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma game will choose to cooperate.<p>Conversely, Nash equilibria are no longer &quot;stable&quot; in the original sense that there is no incentive for any player to unilaterally deviate. The concept of &quot;unilaterally deviating&quot; doesn&#x27;t even make sense, because a group of superrational players will all choose the same strategy. The superrationality allows them to cooperatively deviate.<p>To demonstrate, I consider the smallest case for which your equilibrium strategy differs from the wiki pages&#x27; strategy, that is n=3. Suppose there are 3 pirates, A, B and C. Suppose the first pirate proposes that he gets all the coins. Then the state where everyone votes yes is a Nash equilibrium because no one has an incentive to unilaterally. However I claim that a group of supperrational players will vote to kill A.<p>Here is the proof of my claim (caveat: I don&#x27;t think this is actually a valid analysis - see next paragraph. however it&#x27;s the same level of rigor as the wiki page and demonstrates how B and C can cooperate to kill A, &quot;escaping&quot; the NE of both voting Y). C will vote No because accepting the proposal is the worst possible outcome for him (he gets 0 gold and no one dies; note that it is not possible for C to die), so strategies where he votes No in this round dominate strategies where he votes Yes in this round. B knows that C is thinking this. Hence he will vote No.<p>Explanation of caveat: actually, the nonstrict dominance proof in the above paragraph suggests that C does not know how B will vote and the dominance is nonstrict because of this unknown. However, since B and C are superrational, there is no such thing as not knowing how someone would vote; C knows that B will vote No, so the dominance is strict. However this argument seems circular (even though, because of superrationality, I think it really isn&#x27;t).<p>Unrelated point: If we ammend the rules of the pirate game to include another tiebreaker with lowest priority: that all pirates prefer to vote &quot;no&quot;, then your situation is no longer even a Nash equilibrium (much less a subgame-perfect NE). Then how many NEs are there in the ammended game?","time":1452757655,"type":"comment"},{"by":"throwaway2048","id":10900098,"kids":[10900269,10900120],"parent":10900061,"text":"NetBSD ZFS has rather severe bugs, was this addressed by bitrig?

Best wishes to the team; hopefully they find the plane so we can finally get some closure on this tragedy.<p>Here&#x27;s a link to their search progress page:\n<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jacc.gov.au&#x2F;families&#x2F;operational_reports&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jacc.gov.au&#x2F;families&#x2F;operational_reports&#x2F;</a>","time":1452755178,"type":"comment"},{"by":"empressplay","id":10900015,"kids":[10900584],"parent":10899885,"text":"Yes, but they&#x27;ll put ads in front of them and give the money to the rights holder, which is not a hindrance producers who create original material will have to suffer with.","time":1452754897,"type":"comment"},{"by":"pilif","id":10900009,"kids":[10900023,10900031],"parent":10899997,"text":"I haven&#x27;t used facebook in s long time, but I would have said that messages posted on people&#x27;s walls (the more emails looking screenshot) are different from Facebook messenger chat messages (the chat looking screenshot), so it&#x27;s totally up to the user to decide which one is posted where.
